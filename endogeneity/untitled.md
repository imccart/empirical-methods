# Endogeneity

So you think you have an endogeneity problem? Well, you're not alone. But if the question is important enough, surely there's something we can do. Right?

In this section, I'm assuming that you have an endogeneity problem without any obvious solution. No instruments, no policy "shock", no discontinuity, no "quasi" or "natural" experiment. Basically, you're stuck with a problem and without any clear strategy to point identify the casual effect of interest.

All hope is not lost. You can essentially start making some more assumptions and/or test how sensitive your results are to selection on unobservables. Take a look at the [endogeneity flowchart]({{<ref "/endog/flowchart" >}}) to help navigate this type of situation.
